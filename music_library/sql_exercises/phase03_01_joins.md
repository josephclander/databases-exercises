Use a JOIN query to select the id and title of all the albums from Taylor Swift.

You should get the following result set:
```
 id |  title   
----+----------
  6 | Lover

```
my solution:

```sql
SELECT albums.id,
		albums.title
FROM albums
	JOIN artists
	ON artists.id = albums.artist_id
WHERE artists."name" = 'Taylor Swift';
```

## Exercise Two
